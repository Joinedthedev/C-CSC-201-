# CSC-201-
A somewhat comprehensive documentation of everything we've done so far.

This is basically my attempt of trying to help everyone pass this class and comprehend whats going on. 
I am, to the best of my ability, going to update this repository as often as possible.
Therein lies all the code we covered and some documentation I wrote for comprehension and logic.
Dear reader, I sincerely hope this aids you in some way. IF not, I hope you come across something that does.
With that being said, welcome to the repository of CSC 201.
